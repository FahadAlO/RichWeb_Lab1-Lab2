Q1) Explain what is meant by Rich Web Application Development. Distinguish it from traditional web development?

Early internet users mostly exchanged text-based electronic mail message. Then along came HTML and the World Wide Web, and soon people were looking at graphically enhanced web pages designed by specialists and served up on demand. All these application mainly involved reading text on-screen and dealing with material that was preformatted and essentially. Whole development model has changed. We had limitation on client – side processing power. So we set up high – end servers, produced most of the HTML content on the server side and sent it to the client. On the client side, we just used JavaScript to validate user’s input. The modern web development architecture, Restful APIs lies on server that sends data to client upon request and client side framework create dynamic pages on the fly without even page refresh. The same REST API’s also server to mobile apps. Client side framework also provides other feature too like 2-way data binding, master page layout, routing and descriptive html.  Traditional websites can expect users to move in a vertical pattern, while mobile users tend to navigate side to side, that is, left to go back to the home page, right to go to the next page. 




Q2) What is the Document Object Model? Explain, giving a couple of examples, how to interact with the DOM in JavaScript?

Connects web pages to scripts or programming language. Usually that means JavaScript, but modelling HTML, SVG or XML documents as objects is not part of the JavaScript language. The DOM model represents a document with a logical tree. The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents separated into 3 different parts:

•	Core DOM - standard model for all document types.
•	XML DOM - standard model for XML document.
•	HTML DOM - standard model for HTML document.

The document object represents web page if you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object finding html elements, changing html elements, adding and deleting elements, adding events handlers and finding html objects
